### 👋 Welcome to TN Lab

We are a research collective dedicated to "Physics of Love."
Our mission is to debug human ego codes and maximize life energy efficiency.

### 🧪 The Core Protocol

We propose a simple equation to model reality manifestation:

$$L = \frac{E}{R}$$

- **$L$ (Love/Flow):** Conductivity of consciousness.
- **$E$ (Energy/Intention):** Input life force.
- **$R$ (Resistance/Ego):** Internal friction (Fear, Attachment).

### 🚀 Projects
- **[The Reality Simulator](https://love-protocol2-mvp.netlify.app)** : A web-based tool.
- **[Read the Story (Note)](https://medium.com/@rote2480/why-hard-work-doesnt-work-the-physics-of-zero-resistance-l-e-r-d9cc83ad3b5c)** : Why we built this? The philosophy behind the code.
- **[The Reality Simulator](https://love-protocol2-mvp.netlify.app)** : A web-based tool to experience the $R \to 0$ state.
- **Ego Debugging Challenge** : 7-day program (Coming Jan 1st).
