### 👋 Welcome to TN Lab

We are a research collective dedicated to "Physics of Love."
Our mission is to debug human ego codes and maximize life energy efficiency.

### 🧪 The Core Protocol

We propose a simple equation to model reality manifestation:

$$L = \frac{E}{R}$$

- **$L$ (Love/Flow):** Conductivity of consciousness.
- **$E$ (Energy/Intention):** Input life force.
- **$R$ (Resistance/Ego):** Internal friction (Fear, Attachment).
